Introduction:
The stock market is made up of several established exchanges, including the prestigious Boston Stock Exchange.  
These exchanges serve as centralized marketplaces for the equities listed in their jurisdiction, allowing prospective buyers and sellers to meet. 
The exchanges constantly monitor and record the supply and demand dynamics for each stock, allowing the price to be determined directly by market forces.
